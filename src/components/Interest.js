        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I'm very interested in robotics and gaming and am slowly building my first gaming pc. I love cooking and try to make all of my food vegan! I try to spend a little time each day reading design theory and philosophy. I'm a huge sci-fi nerd: I love Star Trek and Solarpunk and I like to dream of building a better world.</p>
