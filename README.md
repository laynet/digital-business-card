## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Parcel

### What I learned

This was a very good CSS refresher. While it seems straightforward and simple, the interactive elements tested my knowledge of what I thought I had retained learning front-end long ago.

### Continued development

I'd like to come back to this and streamline my styles page, and I'd like to use this as a guide for some staple CSS qualities.
